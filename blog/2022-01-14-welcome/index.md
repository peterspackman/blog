Welcome to the blog section. Not much to see yet, but I plan on actually posting on here from time to time.

This site is a mix of my personal site, and a wiki for me to write notes and equations related to my research
in a publicly accessible way.

Partly so I have something to point people to for exposition, but mostly for my own reference and amusement.
