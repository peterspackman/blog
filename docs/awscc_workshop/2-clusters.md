# 2. From Pairs to Crystals: Many-Body Effects

Moving from isolated pairs to clusters and crystals reveals fundamental challenges in computational chemistry. The total energy is not simply the sum of pairwise interactions. This section explores how to calculate lattice energies using the `occ elat` command and estimate energies with fast semi-empirical methods like xTB.

## The Many-Body Problem

### Why Pairs Don't Tell the Whole Story

Consider three water molecules A, B, and C. The total interaction energy is:

$$E_{ABC} = E_{AB} + E_{AC} + E_{BC} + \Delta E_{3-body}$$

where $\Delta E_{3-body}$ is the non-additive three-body term. This arises from:

1. **Polarization effects**: A polarizes B, which affects how B interacts with C
2. **Charge transfer**: Electron density redistributes across all three molecules
3. **Exchange repulsion**: Overlapping electron clouds of all three molecules

### Energy Hierarchy in Clusters

For a cluster of N molecules, the many-body expansion is:

$$E_{total} = \sum_{i<j} E_{ij}^{(2)} + \sum_{i<j<k} E_{ijk}^{(3)} + \sum_{i<j<k<l} E_{ijkl}^{(4)} + ...$$

Where:
- $E_{ij}^{(2)}$ = pairwise interactions (typically 85-95% of total)
- $E_{ijk}^{(3)}$ = three-body corrections (5-15%)
- Higher terms usually < 1%

### Physical Origins of Many-Body Effects

The breakdown of pairwise additivity occurs because molecular environments are not independent. When molecule A interacts with molecule B, it changes how A can subsequently interact with molecule C. This leads to several physical effects:

**1. Cooperative Effects (Negative 3-body terms)**
- **Polarization enhancement**: A polarizes B, making B a better hydrogen bond partner for C
- **Charge transfer cascades**: Electrons flow A→B→C, strengthening all interactions
- **Common in**: π-stacking, metal coordination, extended conjugated systems

**2. Anti-cooperative Effects (Positive 3-body terms)**  
- **Polarization saturation**: A polarizes B, leaving B less able to interact with C
- **Electrostatic screening**: Charges reorganize to minimize unfavorable interactions
- **Common in**: Hydrogen bonding networks, ionic solutions

**3. Mixed Effects**
- **Real systems** often show both types depending on geometry and chemical environment
- **Water clusters** typically show weak anti-cooperativity (~5% of binding)
- **Overall magnitude** determines whether pairwise models are adequate

The key insight is that **many-body effects are not just corrections - they reveal fundamental physics** about how molecular interactions depend on chemical environment.

### The Crystal Challenge

<Figure

  alt="Periodic boundary conditions in crystals" 
  caption="Infinite crystal represented by periodic unit cells"
  width="300px"

/>

In a crystal, we face additional complexity:

1. **Infinite interactions**: Each molecule interacts with infinite neighbors
2. **Long-range electrostatics**: Decay as $r^{-1}$, requiring special summation techniques
3. **Periodic boundary conditions**: The unit cell represents infinite repetition

The lattice energy is:
$$E_{lattice} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j \neq i}^{\infty} E_{ij}$$

The factor of 1/2 avoids double counting. The sum converges because:
- Electrostatic: Conditionally convergent (depends on summation order)
- Dispersion: Converges as $r^{-6}$
- Total molecules within sphere of radius R: $\propto R^3$
- Total dispersion energy: $\propto R^3 \times r^{-6} = R^{-3}$ → converges

## Computational Exercises

The exercises below demonstrate the concepts outlined above using real calculations. We'll progress from small clusters (where we can calculate everything exactly) to larger systems (where approximations become necessary) to infinite crystals (where pairwise models excel).

### Exercise 1: Many-Body Effects in Water Trimers

This exercise quantifies the breakdown of pairwise additivity for a realistic water trimer extracted from ice crystal structure. We'll calculate all the individual components of the many-body expansion to see how significant three-body effects really are.

### Exercise 2: Convergence of Interaction Energy with Cluster Size

Moving from trimers to larger clusters, we need to understand how interaction energies converge with system size. This is crucial for simulation cutoffs and for understanding when finite cluster calculations approximate bulk behavior. We'll use fast semi-empirical xTB calculations to study clusters with dozens of molecules.

### Exercise 3: Lattice Energy and Crystal Cohesion

Finally, we tackle infinite crystals using the CE-1P pairwise summation approach. This exercise demonstrates how pairwise models can work surprisingly well for molecular crystals, despite the many-body effects we've just studied. The key insight is that while individual three-body terms matter, their collective effect in crystals is often well-approximated by cleverly parameterized pairwise models.

## Connecting Theory to Practice: What We've Learned

The three exercises above demonstrate key principles of many-body interactions and crystal energetics:

**From Exercise 1 (Water Trimers):**
- Many-body effects are real but modest (~5%) for hydrogen-bonded systems
- Anti-cooperative effects in water arise from polarization saturation
- Individual three-body terms can be calculated exactly for small systems

**From Exercise 2 (Cluster Convergence):**
- Long-range interactions (>8 Å) contribute ~10% to total binding
- Simulation cutoffs represent accuracy vs. cost tradeoffs
- Different properties (energies vs. forces vs. phase behavior) may require different cutoffs

**From Exercise 3 (Crystal Lattice Energies):**
- Pairwise models work remarkably well (~7% error) for molecular crystals
- This success occurs despite measurable many-body effects in small clusters
- Effective parameterization can capture collective many-body contributions

**The Paradox Resolved:**
How can pairwise models work so well for crystals when we just showed many-body effects are important? The answer lies in **error cancellation** and **effective parameterization**:

1. **Many-body effects are systematic** - they occur similarly throughout the crystal
2. **CE-1P includes implicit many-body terms** through its polarization model and fitted parameters
3. **Collective effects average out** - individual cooperative/anti-cooperative terms partially cancel
4. **Reference data includes many-body effects** - CE-1P was fitted to high-level calculations that capture these effects

This is why **understanding fundamentals matters** - it helps you recognize when approximations will work and when they'll fail.

## The CE-1p Model for Crystals

The CE-1p model extends naturally from dimers to crystals by summing pairwise interactions. It captures the essential physics while remaining computationally efficient:

- **Input**: Crystal structure + monomer wavefunctions
- **Output**: Lattice energy with physical decomposition
- **Speed**: ~1000x faster than full periodic DFT
- **Accuracy**: 5-10% error for molecular crystals
- **Many-body effects**: Partially included via polarization scaling

## Understanding Energy Units in Crystals

:::warning[Critical Concept]
Always specify what your energy is **per unit of**. This is one of the most common sources of error in computational crystal studies!
:::

### Different Ways to Report Crystal Energies

- **Per molecule**: Energy to remove one molecule from crystal
- **Per unit cell**: Energy for the entire repeating unit  
- **Per asymmetric unit**: Energy for symmetry-unique part
- **Per formula unit**: Energy for the simplest stoichiometric unit
- **Per atom**: Often used in benchmarking studies for fair comparison

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

**Example 1: Ice vs. Salt**
- Ice: H₂O → 1 molecule per formula unit
- NaCl: Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → 2 ions per formula unit  
- Comparing "-800 kJ/mol" for NaCl vs "-63 kJ/mol" for ice is meaningless!
- Must compare: NaCl (-400 kJ/mol per ion) vs H₂O (-63 kJ/mol per molecule)

**Example 2: Co-crystals and Solvates**
- Paracetamol monohydrate: (C₈H₉NO₂)·(H₂O) → 2 molecules per formula unit
- Pure paracetamol: C₈H₉NO₂ → 1 molecule per formula unit
- To compare stability, normalize per paracetamol molecule, not per formula unit

**Example 3: Polymorphs**
- Form I: 2 molecules in asymmetric unit → divide by 2 for per-molecule energy
- Form II: 4 molecules in asymmetric unit → divide by 4 for per-molecule energy
- Only then can you compare which polymorph is more stable

For ice example:
- Asymmetric unit energy: -125.6 kJ/mol (contains 2 H₂O)
- Per formula unit (H₂O): **-62.8 kJ/mol per molecule**
- Experimental sublimation: **+54.1 kJ/mol per molecule** (opposite sign)

**Why benchmarking studies use "per atom" units:**
Many computational method comparisons report errors in **meV/atom** rather than per unit cell or per molecule. This allows fair comparison across:
- Small molecules (few atoms) vs. large molecules (many atoms)
- Different crystal packing (1 vs. 8 molecules per unit cell)
- Various stoichiometries (AB vs. A₂B₃ compounds)

For example, a state-of-the-art method like [PET-MAD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14118) achieves ~20 meV/atom error:
- H₂O (3 atoms): 60 meV = 5.8 kJ/mol of water molecules
- Paracetamol (20 atoms): 400 meV = 38.6 kJ/mol of paracetamol molecules

For the most accurate bespoke dataset, errors can be as low as 3 meV/atom:
- H₂O (3 atoms): 9 meV = 0.9 kJ/mol of water molecules
- Paracetamol (20 atoms): 60 meV = 5.8 kJ/mol of paracetamol molecules
- Both represent the same **relative accuracy per atom**


## Connecting to Experiments: Sublimation Thermodynamics

For molecular crystals, the experimental sublimation enthalpy relates to our calculated lattice energy:

$$\Delta H_{sub} = -E_{lattice} + 2RT$$

The 2RT term (~5 kJ/mol at 298K) accounts for the difference between constrained vibrations in the crystal and free translation/rotation in the gas phase. For ice:

- Calculated $E_{lattice}$ = -62.8 kJ/mol
- Predicted $\Delta H_{sub}$ = 62.8 - 4.96 = 57.8 kJ/mol
- Experimental = 54.1 kJ/mol (7% error)

This excellent agreement validates the CE-1p approach for molecular crystals.

## Practical Considerations and Challenges

### Convergence Issues with Ionic Crystals

The NaCl example demonstrates why simple cutoff-based summation fails for ionic systems. The long-range $r^{-1}$ electrostatics lead to:
- Wild energy oscillations with cutoff radius
- Dependence on summation order
- Need for Ewald summation or similar techniques

### Polymorphism: When Small Differences Matter

Many pharmaceutical compounds have multiple crystal forms (polymorphs) with energy differences < 5 kJ/mol. Since RT ≈ 2.5 kJ/mol at room temperature, thermal effects can reverse stability rankings. This is why:
- Temperature-dependent studies are crucial
- Kinetic factors often control which form crystallizes
- Computational predictions need ~1 kJ/mol accuracy

### Visualizing Crystal Energetics

Tools like CrystalExplorer can generate "energy frameworks" - 3D visualizations where tube thickness represents interaction strength. This reveals:
- Hydrogen bonding networks
- π-π stacking columns  
- Mechanical anisotropy origins

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Many-body effects** are real and measurable - the water trimer shows ~25% anti-cooperative effects

✓ **Energy units matter** - always specify per molecule, per formula unit, or per atom

✓ **Pairwise models work surprisingly well** - CE-1p achieves ~10% accuracy by smart parameterization

✓ **Convergence differs by system** - molecular crystals converge smoothly, ionic crystals oscillate wildly

✓ **Small energy differences** have big consequences - polymorphs often differ by < RT

✓ **Connect to experiment** through proper thermodynamics - don't forget the 2RT term!
