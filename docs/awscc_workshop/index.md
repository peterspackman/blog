# Intermolecular Interactions: From Dimers to Crystals

Welcome to the AWSCC 2025 Workshop! In this workshop we'll explore some of thebackground on intermolecular (or non-bonded) interactions, predicting the energies associated with these interactions, and how they might be used to rationalise/understand crystal structures and crystal growth.

This material will likely exceed the allocated time, but I'm hopeful that it will remain as a useful resource for independent work for those interested.
