# Intermolecular Interactions: From Dimers to Crystals

Welcome to the AWSCC 2025 Workshop! In this workshop we'll explore some of the background on intermolecular (or non-bonded) interactions, predicting the energies associated with these interactions, and how they might be used to rationalise/understand crystal structures and crystal growth.

This comprehensive material is designed to serve as both a workshop guide and a reference for independent study. While we may not cover everything during the workshop, all resources will remain available for further exploration.
