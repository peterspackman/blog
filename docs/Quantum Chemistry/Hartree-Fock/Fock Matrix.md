# Fock Matrix

The Fock matrix $\hat{F}$ is an approximation of the single electron
energy operator of a given system.

In Hartree-Fock thoery, the Fock matrix will be given by:

$$
\hat{F} = \hat{H}_{core} + 2 \hat{J} - \hat{K}
$$

where $\hat{J}$ is the Coulomb operator i.e. the repulsion between two electrons in the system
and $\hat{K}$ is the Exchange operator i.e. arising from the exchange any two (indistinguishable) electrons.
