# Software

As part of my research, or for fun, I write a lot of software.


## CrystalExplorer 

I've been the maintainer and primary developer for [CrystalExplorer](https://crystalexplorer.net) since ca. 2016.
It's a pretty popular program, used by thousands of people all across the globe.

I also maintain the [wiki](https://wiki.crystalexplorer.net), and made the [website](https://crystalexplorer.net)!
Plus there's a repository of [scripts](https://github.com/peterspackman/crystalexplorer-scripts) which might come in
handy for the curious.


## chmpy

My own python (cython &amp; C) library for various utility things including Hirshfeld surfaces, spherical harmonic
shape descriptors, elastic tensors, general manipulation of crystals and molecules and much more!

## SBF

I made a quick and dirty binary file format for interoperating between C, fortran, C++ and python. The implementation
(and probably the design) could do with some work, but it's been used for a while in CrystalExplorer and makes my 
life easier from time to time!

## Tonto

This one is mostly not me, but I made a lot of contributions to tonto during my PhD. Things have slowed down a bit 
in the meantime, but since I rewrote the build system and migrated the codebase to git &amp; made the tests run in 
an acceptable amount of time among other things I take some of the blame for the program.
